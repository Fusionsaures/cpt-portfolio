            <h1>Welcome to Ezekiel's Portfolio</h1>
            <p>My name is Ezekiel Buniel, I am 17 years old. I’ve been on a journey of self-discovery since starting high school, constantly asking, A big part of my identity comes from my background. I was born in the Philippines and lived there until I was seven, surrounded by a vibrant culture and close-knit community. When my mom and I moved to Canada, that transition deeply shaped my worldview. Now, as I explore my future, I’m excited to accept an offer from a college that aligns with my goals. I believe living a balanced life, managing school, relationships, health, and personal growth, is key to happiness and fulfillment. Striving for balance allows me to be productive without burning out and present without losing ambition. My God-given purpose is to pursue a career in computer science to advance technology and help others through innovation. I see technology as a tool for growth, connection, and making the world better. Guided by prayer and reflection, I seek to make decisions that align with God’s will and trust that He will open doors through education, partnerships, and meaningful projects. Building strong relationships with family, friends, and mentors keeps me grounded and reminds me that I am not alone in this journey. I believe my purpose goes beyond personal success. It’s about lifting others up, whether through volunteering, community work, or being a supportive friend. With faith as my foundation, I look forward to each step ahead, confident that I am part of a bigger plan as I follow my passions and stay true to my values.</p>
